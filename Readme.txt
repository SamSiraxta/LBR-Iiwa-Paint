Hi!

Thanks for downloading my app and help me out to distribute it all over the NET.
Now on I will explain how it works:

*********************************************************************************

- Main idea was to understand how this robot works on. So there's an huge number 
  of little applications contained on the program.

- There's a Java desktop client based on a Canvas GUI to vectorize our polylines
  and send them to the robot. Same thought carried on an Android system.

 WARNING!

- I've only uploaded the source code to make it work.
- Robot application is way specific in this cobot despite the fact that 
  you may know how to code in Java, so get first a little knowlegde on industrial robotics.
